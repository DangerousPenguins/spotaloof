Spot Aloof

Spot Aloof: Web controls for Spotify is a lightweight, portable and open source, web based way to control Spotify remotely. Spot Aloof runs a Mongoose webserver (http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/) and uses AutoHotkey (http://www.autohotkey.com/) to control the local instance of Spotify. This gives any web browser on the local network the ability to see the current song playing and control pause/play, skip tracks forwards/backwards as well as raise and lower the volume.

Run the server, create a firewall exception then on any computer browse to http://[IPADDRESS]:8080/ and you will see what is currently playing and the controls.
